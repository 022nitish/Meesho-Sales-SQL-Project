SQL Project: Meesho Sales Analysis

This project analyzes Meesho‚Äôs sales dataset using MySQL 8.4.
The goal is to extract business insights such as regional performance, customer profitability, discount patterns, and loss-making cases.

We designed the database, cleaned the data, and applied basic to advanced SQL queries including aggregations, window functions, and analytical queries.
